Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def check_dict_case(dict):\n3     \"\"\"\n4

We now know `i != n + 1` on line 43 of the method `minPath` is likely not the culprit.

We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of `i` and `j` in the test script.\n\nPrediction: If I add `print` statements to the test script, the values of `i` and `j` will be equal to `n`, which is greater than `n - 1` or `n + 1`.\n\nExperiment: `print(minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9))`\nObservation: `*** NameError: name 'minPath' is not defined`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is undecided due to experiment error.\n\n", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

Specifically, I think it is because `sym[i]` is not properly defined for `i` in the range `[0,12]`.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `sym[i]` and `i`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `xix`, it will be `x`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 21, `sym[i] == 'x'` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:21 ;; c ;; p sym[i]`\nObservation: `At each loop execution, the expression was: ['X', '']`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. The value of `sym[i]` is being set correctly, but it's not being printed as expected.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the previous hypothesis was rejected, the method is still producing incorrect results. Looking elsewhere, perhaps the code is not properly converting a mini-roman string to lowercase.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `res`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `xix`, it will be `XIX`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 24, `res == 'XIX'` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:24 ;; c ;; p res`\nObservation: `'X'`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.
