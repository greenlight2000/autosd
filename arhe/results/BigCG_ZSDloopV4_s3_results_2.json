Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script.

Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\n\nI checked the function in the browser, and found that it returns `True` on a case that is actually `False`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expression] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n\nThis means that the hypothesis is true, but this is not the only hypothesis that can be true. The hypothesis is not true because `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is not intended to [desired behavior], rather, it is [erroneous behavior].\n\nHowever, if I change the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d`, the test will pass.\n\nNow, the hypothesis is false. This means that the hypothesis is indeed false, but it is not the only hypothesis that can be true. The hypothesis is not false because the test is not passing.\n\nI will now make a second attempt to debug the issue.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `xExperiment: `expression]`\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: unmatched ']'`\nConclusion:The hypothesis is false. Since the test is not passing, the hypothesis is rejected. It is not the only hypothesis that can be true. The hypothesis is not false because the test is not passing.\n\nI will now make a third attempt to debug the issue.\n\nAttempt3.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\nObservation: `[expr]` should be able to be evaluated.\nConclusion: The hypothesis is true.\n\nI will now make a fourth attempt to debug the issue.\n\nAttempt 4.\nHypothesis: The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: unmatched ']'`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is true.\n\nI will now make a fifth attempt to debug the issue.\n\nAttempt 5.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\nObservation: `[expr]` should be able to be evaluated.\nConclusion: The hypothesis is true.\n\nI will now make a sixth attempt to debug the issue.\n\nAttempt 6.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported.

I observed that `a>b` on line 4321 of `foo` should be `a>b && c>b`, but `a>b` is not correct. I tried to write it as `a>b && c>b && a>c`, which is correct, but did not work.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit.

We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\n\nThis hypothesis was proved incorrect when trying to prove that `[expression]` at line [line] is not the culprit.

Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 \n3 def skjkasdkd(lst):\n4     \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n5     You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n6 \n7     Examples:\n8     For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n9     For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n10     For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n11     For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n12     For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n13     For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n14     \"\"\"\n15 \n16     def isPrime(n):\n17         for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 0):\n18             if n % i == 0:\n19                 return False\n20         return 1\n21     maxx = 0\n22     i = 0\n23     while i < len(lst):\n24         if lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]):\n25             maxx = lst[i]\n26         i += 1\n27     result = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(maxx)))\n28     return result\n29 assert skjkasdkd([0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7]) == 7, skjkasdkd([0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7])\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-3/asd/debugging.py\", line 29, in <module>\n    assert skjkasdkd([0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7]) == 7, skjkasdkd([0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7])\nAssertionError: 8\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndefskjkasdkd(lst):\n    def isPrime(n):\n        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    maxx = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lst):\n        if lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]):\n            maxx = lst[i]\n        i += 1\n    result = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(maxx)))\n    return result\n```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 181, 32, 4, 32, 3, 2, 32, 324, 4, 3]) == 10, 'This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([1, 0, 1, 8, 2, 4597, 2, 1, 3, 40, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1]) == 25, 'This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([1, 3, 1, 32, 5107, 34, 83278, 109, 163, 23, 2323, 32, 30, 1, 9, 3]) == 13, 'This prints if this assert fails 3 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([0, 724, 32, 71, 99, 32, 6, 0, 5, 91, 83, 0, 5, 6]) == 11, 'This prints if this assert fails 4 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([0, 81, 12, 3, 1, 21]) == 3, 'This prints if this assert fails 5 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7]) == 7, 'This prints if this assert fails 6 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([8191]) == 19, 'This prints if this assert fails 7 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([8191, 123456, 127, 7]) == 19, 'This prints if this assert fails 8 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([127, 97, 8192]) == 10, 'This prints if this assert fails 9 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 91}, {"mutant": "def skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def isPrime(n):\n        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) -

I went through the code line by line. I was able to find the problematic line, and see the issue in the code.\n\n\n## Hints\n\nYou should not use `pdb` in your program. Instead, you should use the `debugging` module that I have written.\n\nThe pdb module is not an official module that comes with Python. It is an open source module that you can install from the [Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/).\n\n## Testing\n\nTo test your program, run the following command on the terminal.\n```bash\n$ python -m debugging.py\n```\n\nThe result should be `pdb` will stop here and go to the program's `def check_dict_case(dict):` function.\n\nThen use the pdb debugger to verify that you have the correct code. If the code is correct, the result should be `True`. Otherwise, the program will stop at line `def check_dict_case(dict):` on the first line and look for the error message below.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the program has finished, the result should be `False` and you should run the following command on the terminal.\nExperiment: `CE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `Unknown command; please use REPLACE.`\nConclusion:[exception triggered.]Attempt[exception triggered.]Experiment: `[exception triggered.]`\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: invalid syntax`\nConclusion:[exception triggered.]", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-3/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-3/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef[exception triggered.]```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3) == [1, 2, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1) == [1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]], 4) == [1, 2, 1, 2]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 4, 13, 10], [5, 7, 12, 1], [3, 16, 11, 15], [8, 14, 9, 2]], 7) == [1, 10, 1, 10, 1, 10, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], 5) == [1, 7, 1, 7, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 1, 5], [3, 8, 9], [2, 7, 4]], 8) == [1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 10) == [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 3], [3, 2]], 10) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 149}, {"mutant": "def tri(n):\n    \"\"\"Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in \n    the last couple centuries.

This can be done by:\n\nHypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n3     \"\"\"\n4     Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
