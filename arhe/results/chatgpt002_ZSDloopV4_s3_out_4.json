This can be done by:\n\nHypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error).

Specifically, I think it is because `if word[i].lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', '', 'u']:` on line 19 of method `select_words` is intended to count the number of consonants, but is counting vowels instead.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `n_consonants` and `word`, while given the input `'Hello world'` and `n=4` indicates that `world` should be the only word returned, it will be `Hello` instead.\nExperiment: `python -m pdb debugging.py`\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: invalid syntax`\nConclusion: Undecided.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous attempt was rejected.

I now think `if word[i].lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', '', 'u']:` on line 19 of method `select_words` is wrong because of the empty string `''` that is not a valid vowel in the list.\nPrediction: If I change `if word[i].lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:` the test will pass.\nExperiment: `REPLACE(19, \"['a', 'e', 'i', '', 'u']\", \"['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `[No exception triggered]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\n", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.
