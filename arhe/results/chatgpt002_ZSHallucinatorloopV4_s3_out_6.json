value for grades that are near the boundaries because of the precision issue with floating point numbers.\nPrediction: If I add a `round()` function around each floating point number, the `letter_grade` list will have the correct values.\nExperiment: `numerical_letter_grade([round(4.0, 2), round(3, 2), round(1.7, 2), round(2, 2), round(3.5, 2)])`\nObservation: `['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C',

The string does contain 2 sentences that start with \"I\".\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. The function is failing because it is splitting the sentences using the expression `'[.?!]\\S*'`, which may not be correct.\nPrediction: If I print out the `re.split` function, I will see that it is only splitting into sentences that end with a `'.'`, `'?'`, or `'!'`.\nExperiment: `print(re.split('[.?!]\\\\S*', 'I feel good today.

being set to `'lower'` or `'upper'` because `key.isupper()` or `key.islower()` is not returning the expected result.\n\nPrediction: `key` is set to `'STATE'`, which is an uppercase string.\n\nExperiment: `p key`\nObservation: `STATE`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that `state` is set to `'upper'` if `key.isupper()` is true, `state` is not being set to `'upper'` because `key.isupper()` is returning `False`.\n\nPrediction: `key.isupper()` is `False`\n\nExperiment: `p key.isupper()`\nObservation: `False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that `key.isupper()` is `False`, `state` is not set to `'upper'` because `key.islower()` is not being executed because the `else` clause of line 27 is not reached.\n\nPrediction: `key.islower()` is `False`\n\nExperiment: `p key.islower()`\nObservation: `False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments)

The code is incorrect because the\nreturn value is not False when the dictionary is empty.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the function is intended to return False if the given\ndictionary contains keys of different cases, the code is incorrect because\nthe return value is not False when the dictionary contains keys of different\ncases.\n\nPrediction: When I call check_dict_case({'p': 'pineapple', 'A': 'banana',\n'B': 'banana'}), the return value will be True.\n\nExperiment: `print(check_dict_case({'p': 'pineapple', 'A': 'banana', 'B': 'banana'}))`\nObservation: `True`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. The code is incorrect because the\nreturn value is not False when the dictionary contains keys of different\ncases.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the function is intended to return False if the given\ndictionary contains keys of different cases, the code is incorrect because\nthe function returns True even when the dictionary contains keys of different\ncases.\n\nPrediction: When I inspect the code, I will see that the return value is True\neven when the dictionary contains keys of different cases.\n\nExperiment: `print(check_dict_case({'p': 'pineapple', 'A': 'banana', 'B': 'banana'}))`\nObservation: `True`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. The code is incorrect because the\nfunction returns True even when the dictionary contains keys of different\ncases.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe function returns True even when the dictionary is empty or contains keys\nof different cases.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != n + 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nAttempt 1.\nHypothesis: Given that the error message is \"list index out of range\", the method is overindexing the grid list.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nAttempt 1.\nHypothesis: Given that the grid has n rows and n columns, the error is in line 43 at `temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])`.\nPrediction: If I print `n` and `i` at line 43, `n` will be 4 and `i` will be 3, which is the last row of the grid.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:43 ;; c ;; i ;; p c ;; p i ;; c`\nObservation: `i = 3`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.

I think this is because it does not check whether the end of the string is a space or not.\n\nPrediction: If I change the code to check whether the end of the string is a space and replace it with an underscore, the function will pass the test.\n\nExperiment: `if text[-1] == ' ': new_text += '_'`\nObservation: `Mudasir_Hanif_`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported and the function passes the test. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    new_text = ''\n    i = 0\n    (start, end) = (0, 0)\n    while i < len(text):\n        if text[i] == ' ':\n            end += 1\n        else:\n            if end - start > 2:\n                new_text += '-' + text[i]\n            elif end - start > 0:\n                new_text += '_' * (end - start) + text[i]\n            else:\n                new_text += text[i]\n            (start, end) = (i + 1, i + 1)\n        i += 1\n    if end - start > 2:\n        new_text += '-'\n    elif end - start > 1:\n        new_text += '_'\n    if text[-1] == ' ':\n        new_text += '_'\n    return new_text\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 161}, {"mutant": "def fix_spaces(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, \n    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, \n    then replace all consecutive spaces with - \n    \n    fix_spaces(\"Example\") == \"Example\"\n    fix_spaces(\"Example 1\") == \"Example_1\"\n    fix_spaces(\" Example 2\") == \"_Example_2\"\n    fix_spaces(\" Example   3\") == \"_Example-3\"\n    \"\"\"\n    new_text = ''\n    i = 0\n    (start, end) = (0, 0)\n    while i < len(text):\n        if text[i] == ' ':\n            end += 1\n        else:\n            if end - start > 2:\n                new_text += '-' + text[i]\n            elif end - start > 0:\n                new_text += '_' * (end - start) + text[i]\n            else:\n                new_text += text[i]\n            (start, end) = (i + 1, i + 1)\n        i += 1\n    if end - start > 2:\n        new_text += '-'\n    elif end - start > 0:\n        new_text += ''\n    return new_text", "mut_op": "_str_const_changer", "task_id": "HumanEval/140", "failed_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('Mudasir Hanif ') == 'Mudasir_Hanif_', 'This prints if this assert fails 2 (good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "samples": ["\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    new_text = ''\n    i = 0\n    (start, end) = (0, 0)\n    while i < len(text):\n        if text[i] == ' ':\n            end += 1\n        else:\n            if end - start > 2:\n                new_text += '-' + text[i]\n            elif end - start > 0:\n                new_text += '_' * (end - start) + text[i]\n            else:\n                new_text += text[i]\n            (start, end) = (i + 1, i + 1)\n        i += 1\n    if end - start > 2:\n        new_text += '-'\n    elif end - start > 0:\n        new_text += '_' * (end - start)\n    return new_text\n"], "trace": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

Return True if the three\n5     sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n6     A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n7     90 degree.\n8     Example:\n9     right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n10     right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n11     \"\"\"\n12     return a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c or c * c == a * a + b * b\n13 assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False, right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 13, in <module>\n    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False, right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)\nAssertionError: True\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\n\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given the method `right_angle_triangle` is intended to return the result of whether a triangle is right-angled, it is returning unexpected results because it is using the wrong formula and has the wrong operator, and there are missing parentheses in the formula.\nPrediction: If I change the formula, the operator, and add missing parentheses, the test case will pass.\nExperiment: `REPLACE(13, \"a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c or c * c == a * a + b * b\", \"(a * a + b * b == c * c) or (b * b + c * c == a * a) or (c * c + a * a == b * b)\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    return (a * a + b * b == c * c) or (b * b + c * c == a * a) or (c * c + a * a == b * b)\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 199}]
