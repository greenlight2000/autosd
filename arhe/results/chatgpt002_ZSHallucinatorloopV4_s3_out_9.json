This is because the code is not checking `if word[i].lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']`, which is the opposite of the expected comparison in the code.\nPrediction: If I change the expression `if word[i].lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']` to `if word[i].lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']` the test will pass.\nExperiment: `REPLACE(19, \"if word[i].lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\", \"if word[i].lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `['Uncle']`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef select_words(s, n):    \n    result = []    \n    for word in s.split():        \n        n_consonants = 0        \n        for i in range(0, len(word)):            \n            if word[i].lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:                \n                n_consonants += 1        \n        if n_consonants == n:            \n            result.append(word)    \n    return result\n```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('Mary had a little lamb', 4) == ['little'], 'First test error: ' + str(candidate('Mary had a little lamb', 4))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('Mary had a little lamb', 3) == ['Mary', 'lamb'], 'Second test error: ' + str(candidate('Mary had a little lamb', 3))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('simple white space', 2) == [], 'Third test error: ' + str(candidate('simple white space', 2))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('Hello world', 4) == ['world'], 'Fourth test error: ' + str(candidate('Hello world', 4))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('Uncle sam', 3) == ['Uncle'], 'Fifth test error: ' + str(candidate('Uncle sam', 3))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('a b c d e f', 1) == ['b', 'c', 'd', 'f'], '2nd edge test error: ' + str(candidate('a b c d e f', 1))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 129}, {"mutant": "def select_words(s, n):\n    \"\"\"Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement \n    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly \n    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.\n    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.\n    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.\n    Examples:\n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4) ==> [\"little\"]\n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 3) ==> [\"Mary\", \"lamb\"]\n    select_words(\"simple white space\", 2) ==> []\n    select_words(\"Hello world\", 4) ==> [\"world\"]\n    select_words(\"Uncle sam\", 3) ==> [\"Uncle\"]\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for word in s.split():\n        n_consonants = 0\n        for i in range(0, len(word)):\n            if word[i].lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'U']:\n                n_consonants += 1\n        if n_consonants == n:\n            result.append(word)\n    return result", "mut_op": "_str_const_changer", "task_id": "HumanEval/117", "failed_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('Uncle sam', 3) == ['Uncle'], 'Fifth test error: ' + str(candidate('Uncle sam', 3))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "samples": ["\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    result = []\n    for word in s.split():\n        n_consonants = 0\n        for i in range(0, len(word)):\n            if word[i].lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'U']:\n                n_consonants += 1\n        if n_consonants == n:\n            result.append(word)\n    print(result)\n    return result\n"], "trace": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != n:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `i != n` on line 43 of the method `minPath` is likely not the culprit.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nAttempt 1.\nHypothesis: Given that the error message is \"`list index out of range`\", I think the issue is an `IndexError` that occurs when accessing an invalid index.

Specifically, I think it is because `if end - start > 2` on line 20 of the method `fix_spaces` is not checking for multiple consecutive spaces.\nPrediction: If I change `if end - start > 2` to `if end - start >= 2` on line 20 of the method `fix_spaces`, the test will pass.\nExperiment: `REPLACE(20, \"end - start > 2\", \"end - start >= 2\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `<DEBUGGING DONE>`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    new_text = ''\n    i = 0\n    (start, end) = (0, 0)\n    while i < len(text):\n        if text[i] == ' ':\n            end += 1\n        else:\n            if end - start >= 2:\n                new_text += '-' + text[i]\n            elif end - start > 0:\n                new_text += '_' + text[i]\n            else:\n                new_text += text[i]\n            (start, end) = (i + 1, i + 1)\n        i += 1\n    if end - start >= 2:\n        new_text += '-'\n    elif end - start > 0:\n        new_text += '_'\n    return new_text\n```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow') == 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow', 'This prints if this assert fails 3 (good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 165}, {"mutant": "def file_name_check(file_name):\n    \"\"\"Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    file_name_check(\"example.txt\") # => 'Yes'\n    file_name_check(\"1example.dll\") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)\n    \"\"\"\n    suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    lst = file_name.split(sep='.')\n    if len(lst) != 2:\n        return 'No'\n    if not lst[1] in suf:\n        return 'No'\n    if len(lst[1]) == 0:\n        return 'No'\n    if not lst[0][0].isalpha():\n        return 'No'\n    t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])\n    if t > 3:\n        return 'No'\n    return 'Yes'", "mut_op": "_int_const_changer", "task_id": "HumanEval/141", "failed_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate('.txt') == 'No'", "failing_exception": "<class 'IndexError'>"}], "samples": ["\ndef file_name_check(file_name):\n    suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    lst = file_name.split(sep='.')\n    if len(lst) != 2 or len(lst) == 1:\n        return 'No'\n    if not lst[1] in suf:\n        return 'No'\n    if len(lst[1]) == 0:\n        return 'No'\n    if not lst[0][0].isalpha():\n        return 'No'\n    t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])\n    if t > 3:\n        return 'No'\n    return 'Yes'\n"], "trace": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

Specifically, I think it is because `number %= num[i]` on line 19 of method `int_to_mini_roman` is intended to calculate the remainder after dividing `number` by `num[i]`, but is not doing so.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `number` and `num[i]` while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `26`, `100` for `number`, and `400` for `num[i]`, it will be `26`, `100`, and `500`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 19, `number == 26` and `num[i] == 500` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:19 ;; c ;; p number == 26`\nObservation: `False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. We now know `number %= num[i]` on line 19 of the method `int_to_mini_roman` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `sym[i]` on line 21 of `int_to_mini_roman` should do `C`, but is doing `D`.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `sym[i]` while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `C`, it will be `D`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 21, `sym[i] == \"D\"` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:21 ;; c ;; p sym[i] == \"D\"`\nObservation: `True`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `i = 12` to `i = 9` may fix the code.\n\nPrediction: If I edit the code, the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(12, \"i = 12\", \"i = 9\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `<DEBUGGING DONE>`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\n", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

This can be done by:\n\nHypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation.
