Specifically, I think it is because `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[2]` on line 17 of method `is_happy` is intended to check if the 3 consecutive letters are distinct, but is checking if the 3 consecutive letters are the same.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[2]`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `False`, it will be `True`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 17, `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[2] == True` will be true.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:17 ;; c ;; p s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[2]`\nObservation: `At each loop execution, the expression was: [False, False, True]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[2]` to `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` may fix the code.\nPrediction: If I change `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[2]` to `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]`, the test will pass.\nExperiment: `REPLACE(17, \"s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[2]\", \"s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `[No exception triggered]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef is_happy(s):\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    for i in range(len(s) - 2):\n        if s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 56}, {"mutant": "def numerical_letter_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades\n    to students.

Looking elsewhere, perhaps `state == 'upper' or state == 'lower'` on line 32 of `check_dict_case` should do True, but is doing False.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `state == 'upper' or state == 'lower'`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be True, it will be False; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 32, `state == 'upper' or state == 'lower' == False` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:32 ;; c ;; p state == 'upper' or state == 'lower'`\nObservation: `False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef check_dict_case(dict):\n    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        state = 'start'\n        for key in dict.keys():\n            if isinstance(key, str) == False:\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            if state == 'start':\n                if key.islower():\n                    state = 'lower'\n                else:\n                    state = 'upper'\n            elif state == 'upper' and (not key.isupper()) or (state == 'lower' and (not key.islower())):\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n        return state == 'upper' or state == 'lower'\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 102}, {"mutant": "def check_dict_case(dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower \n    case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.\n    The function should return False is the given dictionary is empty.\n    Examples:\n    check_dict_case({\"a\":\"apple\", \"b\":\"banana\"}) should return True.\n    check_dict_case({\"a\":\"apple\", \"A\":\"banana\", \"B\":\"banana\"}) should return False.\n    check_dict_case({\"a\":\"apple\", 8:\"banana\", \"a\":\"apple\"}) should return False.\n    check_dict_case({\"Name\":\"John\", \"Age\":\"36\", \"City\":\"Houston\"}) should return False.\n    check_dict_case({\"STATE\":\"NC\", \"ZIP\":\"12345\" }) should return True.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        state = 'start'\n        for key in dict.keys():\n            if isinstance(key, str) == False:\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            if state == 'start':\n                if key.isupper():\n                    state = 'upper'\n                elif key.islower():\n                    state = 'lower'\n                else:\n                    break\n            else:\n                break\n        return state == 'upper' or state == 'lower'", "mut_op": "_if_remover", "task_id": "HumanEval/95", "failed_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate({'p': 'pineapple', 'A': 'banana', 'B': 'banana'}) == False, 'Second test error: ' + str(candidate({'p': 'pineapple', 'A': 'banana', 'B': 'banana'}))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "samples": ["\ndef check_dict_case(dict):\n    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        state = 'start'\n        for key in dict.keys():\n            if isinstance(key, str) == False:\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            if state == 'start':\n                if key.isupper():\n                    state = 'upper'\n                elif key.islower():\n                    state = 'lower'\n                else:\n                    break\n            else:\n                break\n        return state == 'upper' and state == 'lower'\n"], "trace": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != n + 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/sungmin/Documents/projects_23/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/home/sungmin/Documents/projects_23/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nAttempt 1.\nHypothesis: Given that the error message is `IndexError: list index out of range`, the method is returning an index out of range. Specifically, I think it is because `i != n + 1` on line 43 of method `minPath` is intended to check if `i` is not the last index of the grid, but is checking if `i` is not the last index of the grid plus one.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `i`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `3`, it will be `4`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 43, `i == 4` will be true.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:43 ;; c ;; p i`\nObservation: `3`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. we now know `i != n + 1` on line 43 of the method `minPath` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])` on line 43 of `minPath` should do append the value of the cell below the current cell, but is doing append the value of the cell below the current cell plus one.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the error message is `IndexError: list index out of range`, the method is returning an index out of range. Specifically, I think it is because `grid[i + 1][j]` on line 43 of method `minPath` is intended to return the value of the cell below the current cell, but is returning the value of the cell below the current cell plus one.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `grid[i + 1][j]`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `1`, it will be `2`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 43, `grid[i + 1][j] == 2` will be true.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:43 ;; c ;; p grid[i + 1][j]`\nObservation: `*** IndexError: list index out of range`\nConclusion: The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of `grid[i + 1]` at line 43.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the error message is `IndexError: list index out of range`, the method is returning an index out of range. Specifically, I think it is because `grid[i + 1]` on line 43 of method `minPath` is intended to return the row below the current row, but is returning the row below the current row plus one.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `grid[i + 1]`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `[12, 13, 10, 1]`, it will be `[5, 16, 14, 4]`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 43, `grid[i + 1] == [5, 16, 14, 4]` will be true.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:43 ;; c ;; p grid[i + 1]`\nObservation: `*** IndexError: list index out of range`\nConclusion: The previous experiment ended in an error.

Specifically, I think it is because `c * c == a * a + b * b` on line 12 of method `right_angle_triangle` is intended to return False, but is returning True.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `c * c == a * a + b * b`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be False, it will be True; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 12, `c * c == a * a + b * b == True` will be true.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:12 ;; c ;; p c * c == a * a + b * b`\nObservation: `False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. we now know `c * c == a * a + b * b` on line 12 of the method `right_angle_triangle` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `a * a == b * b + c * c` on line 12 of `right_angle_triangle` should do False, but is doing True.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the test case is `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)`, the method is returning True. Specifically, I think it is because `a * a == b * b + c * c` on line 12 of method `right_angle_triangle` is intended to return False, but is returning True.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `a * a == b * b + c * c`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be False, it will be True; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 12, `a * a == b * b + c * c == True` will be true.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:12 ;; c ;; p a * a == b * b + c * c`\nObservation: `False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. we now know `a * a == b * b + c * c` on line 12 of the method `right_angle_triangle` is likely not the culprit.

This can be done by:\n\nHypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error).
