The debugger should be able to inspect the line of code.\n9. The debugger should be able to examine the value of a variable.\n10.

We can find the line by searching for a line containing the word \"breakpoint\". To do so, I use the python `find()` method on the line.\n\nI use the pdb method to examine the code at the breakpoint line. The code will be in one of three states:\n\n1. Code before the breakpoint\n2. Code between the breakpoint and the line containing the breakpoint\n3. Code after the line containing the breakpoint\n\nThe breakpoint line will be the one with a \"breakpoint\" word in it.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe first section of the code is the \"hypothesis\". I have used the `_scientific method_` to write the code.\n\nI have used `assert` to specify that the hypothesis is confirmed, and used `run` to evaluate the code before and after the breakpoint. It is best to use the `run` method to test the hypothesis when it is confirmed, and to use `assert` to assert that the hypothesis is not confirmed.\n\n## Issues\n\nI have found the following issues with the code.\n\n1. The code is not fully tested.\n2. There are more than 3 breakpoint lines.\n3. There is a bug in the code.\n\n## Solutions\n\nI have also included these solutions.\n\n1. `debugging.py`\n2. `debugging.py`\n3. `debugging.py`\n\n\n## Other References\n\nI have found that the pdb module can be used to inspect the code on a line.\n\nI have used the python `find()` method to find the line containing a breakpoint.

I see this is the default behavior of the `while` loop.\n\nI think the function code is that that the code inside the `while` loop is `a <= d`.\n\nI know that the code is causing the error, but how much of it is causing the error?\n\nI know that the code is causing the error.

Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\n\nI removed `&&` from line 4321 and replaced it with `or`. Hence the `False` result.\n\nIf the observation is `[False]`, the hypothesized code is correct.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\n\nI checked the original code again.\n\nThe following is the hypothesis: The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-4/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-4/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef[exception triggered.]```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3) == [1, 2, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1) == [1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]], 4) == [1, 2, 1, 2]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 4, 13, 10], [5, 7, 12, 1], [3, 16, 11, 15], [8, 14, 9, 2]], 7) == [1, 10, 1, 10, 1, 10, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], 5) == [1, 7, 1, 7, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 1, 5], [3, 8, 9], [2, 7, 4]], 8) == [1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 10) == [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 3], [3, 2]], 10) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 149}, {"mutant": "def tri(n):\n    \"\"\"Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in \n    the last couple centuries.

I have been using other methods to debug, and the majority of the time, I make \"experiments\". For the most part, I have used a single line for each experiment. All experiments are expected to be independent, and the results of each may or may not be the same.\n\nI am not a complete program developer, but I do have experience with the python programming environment. If you are interested in learning how to use it, I have written a program that will help you understand how to use it. My program works by taking in an input and a hypothesis, the one you are looking for, and then asking if the desired behavior is true or not. The user will have the option to change the expression with each iteration.\n\nWhen I made this program, I was aware of the following problems:\n\n1. The current expression is actually a literal expression (a string, a number, a boolean expression, or a list). I was trying to prevent the user from changing the expression.\n\n2. The expression I used to check the desired behavior is actually a variable, and the expression will change with each iteration.\n\n3.

I manually changed the line to print [expr], and I see that the output is [erroneous value].\n\nThe conclusion was that the hypothesis was not true.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\n\nI inspected the code and determined that the method `foo` is correct.\n\nI then tested the hypothesis by changing the code to check that `a <= d` and found that it is correct.\n\nI thenExperiment: `EPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\")`\nObservation: `*** NameError: name 'EPLACE' is not defined`\nConclusion:The hypothesis was not true.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution is to use the debugger to set a breakpoint and execute the code line by line.\n\nI then manually examine the line and change it, and then run the experiment.\n\nI then change the code to check that `a <= d` and found that it is correct.\n\nI then change the code to execute the experiment, printing the result.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe hypothesis was not true. I attempted to find the bug.\n\nI then looked at the code, and changed the code until the bug was fixed.\n\nI then run the experiment.\n\nI then changed the code to execute the experiment, printing the result.\n\nI then found the bug.\n\nI then changed the code to fix the bug.\n\nI then run the experiment.\n\nI then did a few experiments to verify the hypothesis.\n\n## References\n\n[1] _Debugging: A Method for Debugging Computers and Systems_ by J.

Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior]. There are several possible reasons why this is the case. \n\nFirst, `c>b` on line 4321 is intended to [desired behavior], but it is [erroneous behavior]. Hence, the hypothesis is that the implementation of `foo` can be improved and the desired behavior is now achieved. This is why I decided to examine the value of `c>b` on line 4321.\n\nSecond, the `c>b && a <= d` condition on line 4321 is not true. Hence, it is likely that the output of `foo` should be [erroneous value]. This is due to the fact that `c>b && a <= d` is a condition of the [desired behavior] and because it is not true, the hypothesis becomes supported. (Also, the output of `foo` is not [desired value].)\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].
