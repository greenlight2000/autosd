Specifically, I think it is because the dictionary `dic` on line 24 of the `by_length` method is intended to replace the digits with the correct corresponding names, but it is replacing the digit 5 with the incorrect name `FIVE`.\n\nPrediction: Given that I use the debugger to print `dic.keys()` and `dic.values()`, I expect to see that the key for 5 is `FIVE`.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:24; p dic.keys(); p dic.values()`\nObservation: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. The dictionary `dic` on line 24 is not the source of the incorrect behavior.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. I now know that the dictionary `dic` on line 24 is likely not the cause of the incorrect behavior. Looking elsewhere, perhaps the code on line 29 that appends elements to `new_arr` should append only digits between 1 and 9 but is appending negative numbers.\n\nPrediction: Given that I use the debugger to print `var` at line 27 and check if `var` is between 1 and 9.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:27; p var > 0 and var < 10; n`\nObservation: `False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. The code on line 29 appends numbers that are not between 1 and 9.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing line 29 to `if var > 0 and var < 10: new_arr.append(dic[var])` may fix the code.\n\nPrediction: Given that I change line 29 to `if var > 0 and var < 10: new_arr.append(dic[var])`, the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(29, \"new_arr.append(dic[var])\", \"if var > 0 and var < 10: new_arr.append(dic[var])\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `AssertionError: ['Eight', 'FIVE', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One']`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.

That is, when I stop the debugger at line 43, `i >= n` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:43 ;; c ;; i`\nObservation: `4 >= 3`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the previous hypothesis was supported, the function is producing an out of range index. Specifically, I think it is because `i != n + 1` on line 43 of `minPath` is intended to appended a value from `grid` to `temp` if `i` is less than `n`, but is appending a value that is out of range since `i` is equal to `n`.\n\nPrediction: If I change `i != n + 1` to `i != n - 1`, the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(43, \"i != n + 1\", \"i != n - 1\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `<DEBUGGING DONE>`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    n = len(grid)\n    val = n * n + 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                temp = []\n                if i != 0:\n                    temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n                if j != 0:\n                    temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n                if i != n - 1:\n                    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n                if j != n - 1:\n                    temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n                val = min(temp)\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            ans.append(1)\n        else:\n            ans.append(val)\n    return ans\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 144}, {"mutant": "def minPath(grid, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n    each cell of the grid contains a value.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n39                 if j != 0:\n40                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n41                 if i != n - 1:\n42                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n43                 if j != n - 1:\n44                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n45                 val = min(temp)\n46     ans = []\n47     for i in range(k):\n48         if i % 2 == 0:\n49             ans.append(1)\n50         else:\n51             ans.append(val)\n52     return ans\n53 assert minPath([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6], minPath([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 53, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6], minPath([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12)\nAssertionError: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nAttempt 1.\nHypothesis: Given that `val` is a constant and depends only on the grid size `n`, the path of length `k` returned by `minPath` is not expected to change. Specifically, I think it is because `val` is always the same on line 45.\nPrediction: If I print `val` on line 45, it will be `2`.\nExperiment: `RUN debugging.py:45 ;; p val`\nObservation: `2`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. It seems that `val` is being used as a constant in `minPath`.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that `val` is not supposed to change, the case when `k` is odd is returning the wrong result. Specifically, I think it is because `ans.append(val)` on line 51 is always appending `2` to the `ans` list.\nPrediction: If I print `ans` on line 51, it will be `[1, 2]`.\nExperiment: `RUN debugging.py:51 ;; p ans`\nObservation: `[1, 2]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. It seems that `minPath` is not returning the expected result for `k` odd.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that `temp` is always the same in the current implementation, the function `minPath` is not returning the expected result. Specifically, I think it is because `temp` is always being initialized with the same elements and `val` is being set to the same value.\nPrediction: If I add `print(temp)` on line 38 and re-run the code, it will always print `[2, 3, 1]`.\nExperiment: `INSERT(38, \"print(temp)\") AND RUN debugging.py`\nObservation: `[2, 3, 1]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. It seems that `temp` is always the same, and `val` is always set to the same constant value.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    n = len(grid)\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            ans.append(1)\n        else:\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                        temp = []\n                        if i > 0:\n                            temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n                        if j > 0:\n                            temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n                        if i < n - 1:\n                            temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n                        if j < n - 1:\n                            temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n                        val = min(temp)\n                        ans.append(val)\n                        break\n                else:\n                    continue\n                break\n    return ans\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 146}, {"mutant": "def minPath(grid, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n    each cell of the grid contains a value.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nAttempt 1.\nHypothesis: Given that the grid is a NxN matrix, the error is from trying to access the index that is out of range.
