The debug method can be called multiple times\n    to create more debug information.\n\n    The debugger is similar to the interactive debugger, but it is also capable of\n    executing a Python program without having to worry about the input,\n    output, and the usual stack trace management.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, program=None, debug=False, profile=Attempt, stack_trace=Attempt1, args=None,\n                 log_directory=None, log_file=None, verbose=False, log_file_path=None,\n                 log_level=Level.DEBUG, log_verbose=False, log_file_level=Level.DEBUG,\n                 log_file_verbose=False, log_file_path=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Debugger can be used by programs that execute a single line of code.\n        If `program` is specified, the debugger will execute that code at that\n        point.\n\n        Arguments:\n\n          - debug (bool):\n            if True, the debugger will execute the program at the point where it\n            is called directly.

Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation.

Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def by_length(arr):\n3     \"\"\"\n4     Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n5     reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n6     \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n7 \n8     For example:\n9       arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n10             -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n11             -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n12       return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n13     \n14       If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n15       arr = []\n16       return []\n17     \n18       If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n19       arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n20             -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n21             -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n22       return = ['One']\n23     \"\"\"\n24     dic = {1: 'One', 2: 'Two', 3: 'Three', 4: 'Four', 5: 'five', 6: 'Six', 7: 'Seven', 8: 'Eight', 9: 'Nine'}\n25     sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)\n26     new_arr = []\n27     for var in sorted_arr:\n28         try:\n29             new_arr.append(dic[var])\n30         except:\n31             pass\n32     return new_arr\n33 assert by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]) == ['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One'], by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3])\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-4/asd/debugging.py\", line 33, in <module>\n    assert by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]) == ['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One'], by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3])\nAssertionError: ['Eight', 'five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One']\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndefy_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n    \"\"\"\n    #

Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def histogram(test):\n3     \"\"\"Given a string

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-4/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-4/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef[exception triggered.]```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3) == [1, 2, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1) == [1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]], 4) == [1, 2, 1, 2]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 4, 13, 10], [5, 7, 12, 1], [3, 16, 11, 15], [8, 14, 9, 2]], 7) == [1, 10, 1, 10, 1, 10, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], 5) == [1, 7, 1, 7, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 1, 5], [3, 8, 9], [2, 7, 4]], 8) == [1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 10) == [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 3], [3, 2]], 10) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 149}, {"mutant": "def tri(n):\n    \"\"\"Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in \n    the last couple centuries.

If I read the script at line 37, the debugger would be [debugging.py:line 37]. The point of this script is to print the number of statements in the script. When in doubt, please leave a comment on the line 37 of the script to make this a bug, since it is a programming error.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n- The code is a very simplified version of the script, without the actual debugger, where the debugger is an additional layer.\n- The debugger runs on a single command line, and has the ability to skip over the traceback when the debugger has stopped.\n- Many of the methods are identical, especially if only one method runs.\n- It does not handle the case when a method is missing a return statement.\n- It does not handle the case where one method returns a list, but it is not a loop.\n- For example, if there are two methods:\n    1. `foo = 3`\n    2. `foo = True`\n    3. `foo = (1, 2.0]`\n    then `foo = 3` should be able to execute a statement, but not a statement.\n- The debugger should not run too often, as it is extremely difficult to test how the debugger works.\n- Debugger's traceback should have the correct format.\n- Debugger's code should have the correct format.\n- Debugger's code should not have `# <comment>` or `# <comment>` on the first line of the code, as it is a test bug.\n- Debugger's code should not have `# <comment>` or `# <comment>` on the last line of the code, as it is a test bug.\n- Debugger's code should not have `# <comment>` or `# <comment>` on the first line of the code, as it is a test bug.\n- Debugger's code should not have `# <comment>` or `# <comment>` on the last line of the code, as it is a test bug.\n- Debugger's code should not have any nested `if` statements, as it is a bug.\n- Debugger's code should not have any nested `while` statements, as it is a bug.\nAttempt[exception triggered.]Experiment: ``\nObservation: ``\nConclusion:[exception triggered.]Attempt[exception triggered.]Experiment: `[exception triggered.]`\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: invalid syntax`\nConclusion:[exception triggered.]", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):\n3     \"\"\"You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.\n4     The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class.
