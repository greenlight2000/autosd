Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported.

Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true.

Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported.

Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true.
