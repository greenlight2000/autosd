Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment.

Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error).

Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n3     \"\"\"\n4     Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n5     sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n6     A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n7     90 degree.\n8     Example:\n9     right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n10     right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n11     \"\"\"\n12     return a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c or c * c == a * a + b * b\n13 assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False, right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-2/asd/debugging.py\", line 13, in <module>\n    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False, right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)\nAssertionError: True\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndefright_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    if a < b + c or b < a + c or c < a + b:\n        return False\n    if a * b == c or b * c == 0:\n        return True\n    a, b, c = map(int, (a, b, c))\n    return right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)\n```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(3, 4, 5) == True, 'This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(1, 2, 3) == False", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(10, 6, 8) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(2, 2, 2) == False", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(7, 24, 25) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(10, 5, 7) == False", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(5, 12, 13) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(15, 8, 17) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(48, 55, 73) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(1, 1, 1) == False, 'This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(2, 2, 10) == False", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 199}]
