Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported.

Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error).

Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment.

Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n6     inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n7 \n8     You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i -

This can be done by:\n\nHypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n3     \"\"\"\n4     Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
