Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script.

Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n6     inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n7 \n8     You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-3/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-3/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef[exception triggered.]```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3) == [1, 2, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1) == [1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]], 4) == [1, 2, 1, 2]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 4, 13, 10], [5, 7, 12, 1], [3, 16, 11, 15], [8, 14, 9, 2]], 7) == [1, 10, 1, 10, 1, 10, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], 5) == [1, 7, 1, 7, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 1, 5], [3, 8, 9], [2, 7, 4]], 8) == [1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 10) == [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 3], [3, 2]], 10) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 149}, {"mutant": "def tri(n):\n    \"\"\"Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in \n    the last couple centuries.

[When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n3     \"\"\"\n4     Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n5     sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n6     A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n7     90 degree.\n8     Example:\n9     right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n10     right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n11     \"\"\"\n12     return a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c or c * c == a * a + b * b\n13 assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False, right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-3/asd/debugging.py\", line 13, in <module>\n    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False, right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)\nAssertionError: True\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndefright_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    if a ** 2 + b ** 2 == c ** 2 or b ** 2 + c ** 2 == a ** 2 or a ** 2 + c ** 2 == b ** 2:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\nassert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\nassert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(3, 4, 5) == True, 'This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(1, 2, 3) == False", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(10, 6, 8) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(2, 2, 2) == False", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(7, 24, 25) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(10, 5, 7) == False", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(5, 12, 13) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(15, 8, 17) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(48, 55, 73) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(1, 1, 1) == False, 'This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)'", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(2, 2, 10) == False", "failing_exception": "<class 'SyntaxError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 199}]
