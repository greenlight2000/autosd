The `SyntaxError` should be a bug.\n\nThe conclusion:\n1. The program is likely to fail with `SyntaxError`.\n2. The `SyntaxError` is likely to be a bug.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf the program fails with `SyntaxError`, it was a bug. If it does not fail with `SyntaxError`, it may be a bug.\n\nLet us debug the program again.\n\nAttempt2.\nHypothesis: If the program fails with `SyntaxError`, the previous program should have also failed.\nPrediction: The program should not fail.\nExperiment: `nput]`\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: unmatched ']'`\nConclusion:[exception triggered.]Attempt.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf the program fails with `SyntaxError`, the previous program should have also failed.\n\n## Solution\n\n## Attempt1\n\n```\nI try to debug the error.

Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n3     \"\"\"\n4     Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
