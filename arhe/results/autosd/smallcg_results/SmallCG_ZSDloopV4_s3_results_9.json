You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 1:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != n - 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3], minPath([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/arhes/humaneval-mutator-exportable-4/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3], minPath([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8)\nAssertionError: [1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nAttempt 1.\nHypothesis: Given thatormation], the method is [overall erroneous behavior].

The debugger is helpful in debugging problems and is useful in debugging code that runs in the command line.\n\n**How to use**\n\nPressing `p` will run the debugged code and save the output. To finish the debugging, press `q`.\n\n**How to use ipdb**\n\n`ipdb` can be used in the command line to debug the code in case of a crash. It is also useful in interactive debugging.\n\nIf you want to use `ipdb`, you should install it first.\n\n**How to use ptpython**\n\n`ptpython` comes with useful features to debug. It is also useful in interactive debugging.\n\n**How to use pytest**\n\npytest is a test runner for Python. It is a powerful and easy tool for running tests. It also has several options, such as controlling the test output and reporting failures.\n\n**How to use pytest -v**\n\npytest can be used with `-v` option to print the test output.\n\n**How to use pytest --cov**\n\npytest can be used with the `--cov` flag to perform coverage analysis.\n\n**How to use pytest --cov-report=html**\n\npytest can be used with the `--cov-report=html` flag to generate a html coverage report. You can also use the `--cov-report=html:skip-covered` flag to skip the coverage report.\n\n**How to use pytest --cov-report=xml**\n\npytest can be used with the `--cov-report=xml` flag to generate an xml coverage report.
