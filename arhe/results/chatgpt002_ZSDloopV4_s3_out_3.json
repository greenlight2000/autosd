Specifically, I think it is because `power < x` on line 17 of method `is_simple_power` is intended to check if `power` is less than `x`, but it is checking if `power` is equal to `x`.\n\nPrediction: If I change `power < x` to `power == x`, the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(17, \"power < x\", \"power == x\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `AssertionError: False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the function is intended to return true if `x` is a simple power of `n`, the method is returning false because it is not computing the correct value of `power`. Specifically, I think it is because `power = power * n` on line 18 of method `is_simple_power` is intended to compute a power of `n`, but is computing a product.\n\nPrediction: If I change `power = power * n` to `power = power ** n`, the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(18, \"power = power * n\", \"power = power ** n\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `AssertionError: False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the function is intended to return true if `x` is a simple power of `n`, the method is returning false because it is not handling the case where `x` is zero. Specifically, I think it is because `power = 1` on line 16 of method `is_simple_power` is intended to initialize the starting value of `power`, but is not handling the case where `x` is zero.\n\nPrediction: If I change `power = 1` to `power = 0` on line 16 of method `is_simple_power`, the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(16, \"power = 1\", \"power = 0\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `AssertionError: False`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.\n\n", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def numerical_letter_grade(grades):\n3     \"\"\"It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades\n4     to students.

Specifically, I think it is because `i != n - 0` on line 43 of method `minPath` is intended to check for the upper bound of the grid, but is not doing so.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `i`, `n`, and `grid`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that `i` should be less than `n`, it will be not. That is, when I stop the debugger at line 43, `i >= n` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:43 ;; c ;; i`\nObservation: `3`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. We now know `i != n - 0` on line 43 of the method `minPath` is likely not the culprit.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was rejected. We now know `i != n - 0` on line 43 of the method `minPath` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `j != n - 1` on line 45 of `minPath` should check for the right bound of the grid, but is not doing so.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `j`, `n`, and `grid`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that `j` should be less than `n`, it will be not. That is, when I stop the debugger at line 43, `j >= n` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:45 ;; c ;; j`\nObservation: `*** The 'jump' command requires a line number`\nConclusion: The experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of `j` at line 45.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of `j` at line 45.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `j`, `n`, and `grid`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that `j` should be less than `n`, it will be not.

Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]\n\n## Description\n\nI have the following python function and test (at debugging.py)\n\n```python\n1 \n2 def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n3     \"\"\"\n4     Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n5     sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n6     A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n7     90 degree.\n8     Example:\n9     right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n10     right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n11     \"\"\"\n12     return a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c or c * c == a * a + b * b\n13 assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False, right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 13, in <module>\n    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False, right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)\nAssertionError: True\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    return a * a + b * b == c * c or b * b + a * a == c * c or c * c + a * a == b * b\n```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate(10, 6, 8) == True", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 199}]
