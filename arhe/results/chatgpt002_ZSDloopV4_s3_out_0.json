That is, when I stop the debugger at line 28, `round(num) == 14.5` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `p round(num)`\nObservation: `*** NameError: name 'num' is not defined`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. We now know that the `num` is not defined, because the script is not executed.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the `num` is not defined, the function does not behave correctly. Specifically, I think it is because line 24, `num = float(value)` is intended to convert `value` to a float, but the `value` is not defined.\n\nPrediction: If I run the function with the example input, `value=14.5`, `num` should be 14.5.\n\nExperiment: `closest_integer(\"14.5\")`\nObservation: `*** NameError: name 'closest_integer' is not defined`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. We now know that the `closest_integer` is not defined, because the script is not executed.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the `closest_integer` is not defined, the test fails. Specifically, I think it is because line 32, `assert closest_integer('14.5') == 15, closest_integer('14.5')` is intended to test the function with the example input, but the function `closest_integer` is not defined.\n\nPrediction: If I run the whole script, the test should fail.\n\nExperiment: `run debugging.py`\nObservation: `-> def closest_integer(value):`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.

Specifically, I think it is because the code is returning `True` for `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)`, which is intended to be `False`.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print the output of `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)`, it will be `True`.\nExperiment: `python -m pdb debugging.py`\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: invalid syntax`\nConclusion: The experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)` using another method.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the previous experiment ended in an error, I think that the method's return statement may contain a syntax error.\nPrediction: If I print the output of `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)`, it will be `True`.\nExperiment: `python debugging.py`\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: invalid syntax`\nConclusion: The hypothesis was rejected. We now know the method's return statement may contain a syntax error, but the error message is not informative enough to determine the issue.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the previous hypothesis was rejected, I think that the method's return statement may contain a logical error.\nPrediction: If I print the output of `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)`, it will be `True`.\nExperiment: `print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))`\nObservation: `*** NameError: name 'right_angle_triangle' is not defined`\nConclusion: The experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by checking the method's definition.\n\n", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion. This can be done by:\n\nHypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error).
