The observation shows that the check is not consistent.\n\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef check_dict_case(dict):\n    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        state = 'start'\n        for key in dict.keys():\n            if isinstance(key, str) == False:\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            if state == 'start':\n                if key.isupper():\n                    state = 'UPPER'\n                elif key.islower():\n                    state = 'lower'\n                else:\n                    break\n            elif state == 'UPPER' and (not key.isupper()) or (state == 'lower' and (not key.islower())):\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            else:\n                break\n        return state == 'UPPER' or state == 'lower'\n\nassert check_dict_case({'STATE': 'NC', 'ZIP': '12345'}) == True, check_dict_case({'STATE': 'NC', 'ZIP': '12345'})\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 98}, {"mutant": "def check_dict_case(dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower \n    case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.\n    The function should return False is the given dictionary is empty.\n    Examples:\n    check_dict_case({\"a\":\"apple\", \"b\":\"banana\"}) should return True.\n    check_dict_case({\"a\":\"apple\", \"A\":\"banana\", \"B\":\"banana\"}) should return False.\n    check_dict_case({\"a\":\"apple\", 8:\"banana\", \"a\":\"apple\"}) should return False.\n    check_dict_case({\"Name\":\"John\", \"Age\":\"36\", \"City\":\"Houston\"}) should return False.\n    check_dict_case({\"STATE\":\"NC\", \"ZIP\":\"12345\" }) should return True.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        state = 'start'\n        for key in dict.keys():\n            if isinstance(key, str) == False:\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            if state == 'start':\n                if key.isupper():\n                    state = 'upper'\n                elif key.islower():\n                    state = 'lower'\n                else:\n                    break\n            elif state == 'upper' and (not key.isupper()) or (state == '' and (not key.islower())):\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            else:\n                break\n        return state == 'upper' or state == 'lower'", "mut_op": "_str_const_changer", "task_id": "HumanEval/95", "failed_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate({'p': 'pineapple', 'A': 'banana', 'B': 'banana'}) == False, 'Second test error: ' + str(candidate({'p': 'pineapple', 'A': 'banana', 'B': 'banana'}))", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "samples": ["\ndef check_dict_case(dict):\n    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        state = 'start'\n        for key in dict.keys():\n            if isinstance(key, str) == False:\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            if state == 'start':\n                if key.isupper():\n                    state = 'upper'\n                elif key.lower() == key:\n                    state = 'lower'\n                else:\n                    break\n            elif state == 'upper' and (not key.isupper()) or (state == '' and (not key.lower() == key)):\n                state = 'mixed'\n                break\n            else:\n                break\n        return state == 'upper' or state == 'lower'\n"], "trace": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

This is because `m <= n` on line 13 of the method `rounded_avg` is intended to return -1 when `n` is greater than `m`, but it just returns -1 even when `n` is equal to `m`.\n\nPrediction: This can be confirmed by setting the input to `n = 5, m = 5` and checking the output of the function, which should be 0b101.\n\nExperiment: `rounded_avg(5, 5)`\nObservation: `-1`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Based on the previous hypothesis, I think the `if` statement on line 13 of the method `rounded_avg` is causing the problem. Specifically, `m <= n` should be changed to `m < n` so that the function will return -1 only when `n` is greater than `m` but not when `n` is equal to `m`.\n\nPrediction: If I change `m <= n` to `m < n` on line 13 of the method `rounded_avg`, the test `rounded_avg(5, 5)` will return 0b101.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(13, \"m <= n\", \"m < n\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `'0b101'`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if m < n:\n        return -1\n    summation = 0\n    for i in range(n, m + 1):\n        summation += i\n    return bin(round(summation / (m - n + 1)))\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 111}, {"mutant": "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\n    dic = {1: 'One', 2: 'Two', 3: 'Three', 4: 'Four', 5: '', 6: 'Six', 7: 'Seven', 8: 'Eight', 9: 'Nine'}\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)\n    new_arr = []\n    for var in sorted_arr:\n        try:\n            new_arr.append(dic[var])\n        except:\n            pass\n    return new_arr", "mut_op": "_str_const_changer", "task_id": "HumanEval/105", "failed_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]) == ['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One'], 'Error'", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "samples": ["\ndef by_length(arr):\n    dic = {1: 'One', 2: 'Two', 3: 'Three', 4: 'Four', 5: 'Five', 6: 'Six', 7: 'Seven', 8: 'Eight', 9: 'Nine'}\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)\n    new_arr = []\n    for var in sorted_arr:\n        try:\n            new_arr.append(dic[var])\n        except:\n            pass\n    return new_arr\n"], "trace": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

The code returns `a` instead of `b` because, `temp_a` is greater than `temp_b`.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the code correctly replaces the decimal point of string from ',' to '.', the method is not returning a string as expected. I think it is because line 14 is intended to assign `a` and `b` to `temp_a` and `temp_b` respectively, but `temp_a` and `temp_b` are being assigned `a` and `b` after the code replaces the decimal point.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `temp_a`, and `temp_b`, while given the input `('5,1', '6')` and its intended role indicates that the value of `temp_b` should be `6`, it will be `6`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 21, `temp_b == 6` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:21 ;; c ;; p temp_a ;; p temp_b`\nObservation: `6.0`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.

Specifically, I think it is because `my_val = len([x for x in extensions[1] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])` on line 20 of method `Strongest_Extension` is intended to initialize `my_val` with the strength of the first extension, but is initializing it with the strength of the second extension instead.\nPrediction: If I run the code and print `my_val` at line 20, the value will show that `my_val` is initialized with the strength of the second extension.\nExperiment: `python -m pdb debugging.py && b 20 && c && p my_val`\nObservation: `my_val=0`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. `my_val` is initialized with the strength of the second extension, not the first.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe code is choosing the wrong strongest extension because `my_val` is initialized with the strength of the second extension instead of the first. To fix this, I will replace `extensions[1]` with `extensions[0]` on line 20.\n\nHypothesis: Given that the code computes the strength of an extension as the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in the extension name, the method will choose the correct strongest extension after changing `my_val = len([x for x in extensions[1] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])` to `my_val = len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])`.\nPrediction: If I run the code after changing `my_val = len([x for x in extensions[1] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])` to `my_val = len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])`, the code will pass the test.\nExperiment: `REPLACE(20, \"extensions[1]\", \"extensions[0]\") AND RUN`\nObservation: The test passed.\nConclusion: The hypothesis is confirmed <DEBUGGING DONE>\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):\n    strong = extensions[0]\n    my_val = len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])\n    for s in extensions:\n        val = len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])\n        if val > my_val:\n            strong = s\n            my_val = val\n    ans = class_name + '.' + strong\n    return ans\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 181}, {"mutant": "def cycpattern_check(a, b):\n    \"\"\"You are given 2 words.
