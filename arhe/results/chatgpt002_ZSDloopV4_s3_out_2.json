Specifically, I think it is because `' '.join(sorted([x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x], key=lambda x: value_map[x]))` is intended to join the sorted strings, but is joining the sorted numbers.\nPrediction: The join statement is not joining the strings, but the numbers.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:12 ;; p sorted([x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x], key=lambda x: value_map[x])`\nObservation: `At each loop execution, the expression was: [, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. The join statement is not the cause of the problem.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the program correctly maps the strings to numbers, the method is incorrect because the sort statement is incorrect. Specifically, I think it is because `sorted([x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x], key=lambda x: value_map[x])` is intended to sort the strings, but is sorting the numbers.\nPrediction: The sort statement is not sorting the strings, but the numbers.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:12 ;; p [x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x]`\nObservation: `At each loop execution, the expression was: [, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. The sort statement is not the cause of the problem.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the program correctly maps the strings to numbers and sorts the numbers correctly, the method is incorrect because the split statement is incorrect. Specifically, I think it is because `numbers.split(' ')` is intended to split the string into a list of strings, but is splitting the string into a list of numbers.\nPrediction: The split statement is not splitting the string into a list of strings, but a list of numbers.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:12 ;; p numbers`\nObservation: `At each loop execution, the expression was: [, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.

Specifically, I think it is because the code returns \"YES\" if the number of even numbers in `lst2` is greater than or equal to the number of odd numbers in `lst1` (line 23), but more odd numbers in `lst1` than even numbers in `lst2` are needed in order to make `lst1` a list of only even numbers.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `odd, even` (line 24), the values of `odd, even` will be 3 and 3, respectively.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:24;; c;; p odd, even`\nObservation: `(0, 2)`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported. The code returns \"YES\" if the number of even numbers in `lst2` is greater than or equal to the number of odd numbers in `lst1`, but more odd numbers in `lst1` than even numbers in `lst2` are needed in order to make `lst1` a list of only even numbers.\n\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    odd = 0\n    even = 0\n    for i in lst1:\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            odd += 1\n    for i in lst2:\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            even += 1\n    if odd <= even:\n        return 'YES'\n    return 'NO'\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 122}, {"mutant": "def exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    \"\"\"In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,\n    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\n    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\n    Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    For example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    odd = 0\n    even = 0\n    for i in lst1:\n        if not i % 2 == 1:\n            odd += 1\n    for i in lst2:\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            even += 1\n    if even >= odd:\n        return 'YES'\n    return 'NO'", "mut_op": "_if_negator", "task_id": "HumanEval/110", "failed_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3]) == 'NO'", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "samples": ["\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    odd = 0\n    even = 0\n    for i in lst1:\n        if i % 2 == 1:\n            odd += 1\n    for i in lst2:\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            even += 1\n    if even >= odd:\n        return 'YES'\n    return 'NO'\n"], "trace": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

The value of `val` does not seem to match the expected value.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the function behavior is incorrect, the function is likely not finding the correct minimum path of length k. Specifically, I think it is because `if i % 2 == 0:` on line 49 is intended to alternate between adding the minimum value and 1 to the path, but is only adding 1 to the path.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `ans`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `[1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]`, it will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 53, `ans == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:53 ;; c ;; p ans`\nObservation: `[1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected. The value of `ans` does not seem to match the expected value.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the function behavior is incorrect, the function is likely not finding the correct minimum path of length k. Specifically, I think it is because `temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])` on line 39 is not appending the correct value to `temp`.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `temp`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be `[3]`, it will be `[7]`; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 46, `temp == [7]` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:46 ;; c ;; p temp`\nObservation: `[7, 8, 5]`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is rejected.

This can be done by:\n\nHypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script.
