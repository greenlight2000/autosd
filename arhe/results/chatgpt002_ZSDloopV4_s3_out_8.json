Specifically, I think it is because the condition in line 17 of the method is intended to check if `s[i]` does not equal `s[i + 1]` or `s[i + 1]` does not equal `s[i + 2]`, but is checking if `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]` or `s[i + 1]` equals `s[i]` or `s[i]` equals `s[i + 2]`.\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `s[i]`, `s[i + 1]`, and `s[i + 2]` in line 17, the values will be `'x'`, `'y'`, and `'y'` respectively.\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:17 ;; c ;; p s[i], s[i + 1], s[i + 2]`\nObservation: `('x', 'y', 'y')`\nConclusion: The hypothesis is supported.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the function checks if all 3 consecutive characters are distinct, the function is checking the wrong condition in line 17.

Specifically, I think it is because `result = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(maxx)))` is intended to sum the digits of `maxx`, but is summing the digits of a different value.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `maxx`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be 7, it will be 8; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 27, `maxx == 8` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `p maxx`\nObservation: `*** NameError: name 'maxx' is not defined`\nConclusion: This hypothesis is rejected because the variable is not defined in the scope of the print statement.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: Given that the function is described as finding the `largest prime value` and returning the `sum of its digits`, the method is not computing the correct largest prime value, possibly due to an error in line 24. Specifically, I think it is because `if lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]):` is intended to set `maxx` to the largest prime value, but is setting `maxx` to a different value.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `lst[i]` and `maxx`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that `lst[i]` should be 7 and `maxx` should be 7, they will be 8 and 8, respectively; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 24, `lst[i] == 8` and `maxx == 8` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b 24;;c;;p lst[i];;p maxx`\nObservation: `At each loop execution, the expression was: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]`\nConclusion: This hypothesis is supported because `lst[i]` is being set to 8 when it should be 7.\n\nAttempt 3.\nHypothesis: Given that the function is described as finding the `largest prime value` and returning the `sum of its digits`, the method is not computing the correct largest prime value, possibly due to an error in line 19. Specifically, I think it is because `if n % i == 0:` is intended to ensure that `n` is prime, but is returning False too early.\n\nPrediction: If I use the debugger to print `n` and `i`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that `n` should be 7 and `i` should be 2, they will be 8 and 1, respectively; that is, when I stop the debugger at line 19, `n == 8` and `i == 1` will be true.\n\nExperiment: `b 19;;c;;p n;;p i`\nObservation: `[The breakpoint line was not covered by the test.]`\nConclusion: This hypothesis is undecided due to experiment error.\n\n", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n39                 if j != 0:\n40                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n41                 if i != n - 1:\n42                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n43                 if j != n - 1:\n44                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n45                 val = min(temp)\n46     ans = []\n47     for i in range(k):\n48         if i % 2 == 0:\n49             ans.append(1)\n50         else:\n51             ans.append(val)\n52     return ans\n53 assert minPath([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6], minPath([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 53, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6], minPath([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12)\nAssertionError: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\n\n\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    n = len(grid)\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            ans.append(1)\n        else:\n            ans.append(2)\n    return ans\n```\n", "passed": false, "fail_tests": [{"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 4, 13, 10], [5, 7, 12, 1], [3, 16, 11, 15], [8, 14, 9, 2]], 7) == [1, 10, 1, 10, 1, 10, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], 5) == [1, 7, 1, 7, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1]", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6]", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[6, 1, 5], [3, 8, 9], [2, 7, 4]], 8) == [1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}, {"failing_assertion": "    assert candidate([[1, 3], [3, 2]], 10) == [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]", "failing_exception": "<class 'AssertionError'>"}], "ARHE_id": 146}, {"mutant": "def minPath(grid, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n    each cell of the grid contains a value.

You can start\n9     from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n10     in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n11     cell.\n12     Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n13     necessarily distinct).\n14     You CANNOT go off the grid.\n15     A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n16     after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n17     through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n18     than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n19     such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n20     lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n21     It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n22     Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n23 \n24     Examples:\n25 \n26         Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n27         Output: [1, 2, 1]\n28 \n29         Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n30         Output: [1]\n31     \"\"\"\n32     n = len(grid)\n33     val = n * n + 1\n34     for i in range(n):\n35         for j in range(n):\n36             if grid[i][j] == 1:\n37                 temp = []\n38                 if i != 0:\n39                     temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n40                 if j != 0:\n41                     temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n42                 if i != 1:\n43                     temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n44                 if j != n - 1:\n45                     temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n46                 val = min(temp)\n47     ans = []\n48     for i in range(k):\n49         if i % 2 == 0:\n50             ans.append(1)\n51         else:\n52             ans.append(val)\n53     return ans\n54 assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n```\n\nwhich fails with the error message\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 54, in <module>\n    assert minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9) == [1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1], minPath([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9)\n  File \"/Users/sungmin/Documents/work/humaneval-mutator/asd/debugging.py\", line 43, in minPath\n    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing the scientific method, I debugged the issue as follows.\n\nThe repaired code (full method, without comments) is:\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    n = len(grid)\n    val = n * n + 1\n    start = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                start = (i, j)\n                break\n        if start is not None:\n            break\n\n    def get_adjacent(x, y):\n        adjacents = []\n        if x > 0:\n            adjacents.append((x - 1, y))\n        if x < n - 1:\n            adjacents.append((x + 1, y))\n        if y > 0:\n            adjacents.append((x, y - 1))\n        if y < n - 1:\n            adjacents.append((x, y + 1))\n        return adjacents\n\n    def get_min(x, y):\n        adjacents = get_adjacent(x, y)\n        min_val = n * n + 1\n        min_pos = None\n        for ax, ay in adjacents:\n            if grid[ax][ay] < min_val:\n                min_val = grid[ax][ay]\n                min_pos = (ax, ay)\n        return min_val, min_pos\n\n    x, y = start\n    ans = [grid[x][y]]\n    for _ in range(k - 1):\n        min_val, min_pos = get_min(x, y)\n        x, y = min_pos\n        ans.append(grid[x][y])\n    return ans\n```\n", "passed": true, "fail_tests": [], "ARHE_id": 149}, {"mutant": "def tri(n):\n    \"\"\"Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in \n    the last couple centuries.

Specifically, I think it is because `a * a == b * b + c / c` on line 12 is intended to check if `a`, `b`, and `c` form a right-angled triangle, but is not checking correctly.\n\nPrediction. If I print the value of `a * a == b * b + c / c`, it will be False.\n\nExperiment. I use the debugger to print the value of `a * a == b * b + c / c`, while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be True.\n\nObservation. False\n\nConclusion. The hypothesis is supported.\n\nAttempt 2.\nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c / c` to `c * c` may fix the code.\n\nPrediction.

This can be done by:\n\nHypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.\n\n - Example hypothesis 1: \"Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 2: \"The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].\"\n - Example hypothesis 3: \"The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.\"\n - Example hypothesis 4: \"The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].\"\n\nPrediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.\n\n - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.\n - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.\n\nExperiment: A specific script that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).\n\n - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`\n - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, \"c>b\", \"c>b && a <= d\") AND RUN`\n\nObservation: The output of the script. Example: `False`\n\nConclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. \n - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error).
