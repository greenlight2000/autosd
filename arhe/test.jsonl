This causes the sorting logic to treat `'zero'` and `'one'` as equal, leading to incorrect sorting behavior.\n\nPrediction: If I inspect the `value_map` dictionary, I will find that both `'zero'` and `'one'` are mapped to the same value (`1`). This would result in the sorting logic failing to distinguish between `'zero'` and `'one'`, causing the output order to be incorrect. Specifically, when the input string contains both `'zero'` and `'one'`, the output may place `'one'` before `'zero'`.\n\nExperiment: `p value_map['zero'] == value_map['one']`\nObservation: `*** NameError: name 'value_map' is not defined`\nConclusion:The hypothesis is **undecided due to experiment error**. The experiment attempted to directly access `value_map` in the global scope, but `value_map` is defined within the function `sort_numbers`, making it inaccessible outside the function's local scope. A refined experiment is needed to inspect the value of `value_map` within the function's context.\n\n---\n\n### Attempt2.  \nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was undecided due to an experiment error. To refine the approach, I hypothesize that the issue lies in the `value_map` dictionary within the function `sort_numbers`. Specifically, the mapping of `'zero'` and `'one'` to the same value (`1`) causes the sorting logic to incorrectly order these two numbers when they appear together in the input string. This ambiguity in the sorting key leads to the observed incorrect output where `'one'` appears before `'zero'`.\n\nPrediction: If I inspect the `value_map` dictionary within the function `sort_numbers`, I will find that both `'zero'` and `'one'` are mapped to the same value (`1`). This would result in the sorting logic failing to distinguish between `'zero'` and `'one'`, causing the output order to be incorrect. Specifically, when the input string contains both `'zero'` and `'one'`, the output may place `'one'` before `'zero'`.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:12 ;; c ;; p value_map['zero'] == value_map['one']`\nObservation: `At each loop execution, the expression was: [True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True]`\nConclusion:The hypothesis is **supported**. The experiment confirmed that both `'zero'` and `'one'` are mapped to the same value (`1`) in the `value_map` dictionary. This causes the sorting logic to treat `'zero'` and `'one'` as equal, leading to incorrect ordering when these two numbers appear together in the input string. Specifically, the output places `'one'` before `'zero'`, which is inconsistent with the expected ascending order.\n\n---\n\n### Attempt3.  \nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported, confirming that the issue lies in the `value_map` dictionary where both `'zero'` and `'one'` are incorrectly assigned the same value (`1`). This causes the sorting logic to treat them as equal, leading to incorrect ordering. To fix this issue, I hypothesize that changing the value of `'zero'` in the `value_map` dictionary to `0` will resolve the problem. This change will ensure that `'zero'` is correctly ordered before `'one'` when sorting.\n\nPrediction: If I modify the `value_map` dictionary by changing the value of `'zero'` from `1` to `0`, the sorting logic will correctly distinguish between `'zero'` and `'one'`. Specifically, when the input string contains both `'zero'` and `'one'`, the output will place `'zero'` before `'one'`, resulting in the expected ascending order.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(11, \"{'zero': 1, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}\", \"{'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, '`\nObservation: `*** SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)`\nConclusion:The hypothesis is **undecided due to experiment error**. The experiment attempted to replace the `value_map` dictionary with a corrected version, but the replacement string was incomplete, leading to a `SyntaxError`. Specifically, the string literal was not properly terminated, causing the Python interpreter to fail during execution. A refined experiment is needed to ensure the replacement string is complete and syntactically valid.\n\n---\n\n### ", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.

Specifically, the key `'one'` is not correctly mapped in the `value_map` dictionary.\n\nPrediction: If I inspect the `value_map` dictionary, I will find that the key `'one'` is either missing or incorrectly mapped.\n\nExperiment: `p value_map`\nObservation: `*** NameError: name 'value_map' is not defined`\nConclusion:The hypothesis is undecided due to experiment error. The `value_map` dictionary was not accessible in the current debugging context, so I need to refine the experiment to ensure the dictionary is properly inspected.\n\n---\n\n### Attempt2.  \nHypothesis: The previous experiment failed because the `value_map` dictionary is not directly accessible in the debugging context. However, the error message still suggests that the key `'one'` is missing or incorrectly mapped in the `value_map` dictionary. To confirm this, I will inspect the dictionary within the function's scope.\n\nPrediction: If I inspect the `value_map` dictionary within the scope of the `sort_numbers` function, I will find that the key `'one'` is either missing or incorrectly mapped.\n\nExperiment: `b debugging.py:12 ;; c ;; p value_map`\nObservation: `At each loop execution, the expression was: [{'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}, {'zero': 0, '': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}]`\nConclusion:The hypothesis is supported. The `value_map` dictionary was successfully inspected within the function's scope, and it reveals that the key `'one'` is missing from the dictionary. Instead, there is an incorrect mapping for an empty string `''` to the value `1`. This explains why the `KeyError: 'one'` occurred when the function attempted to sort the input string.\n\n---\n\n### Attempt3.  \nHypothesis: The previous hypothesis was supported, confirming that the key `'one'` is missing from the `value_map` dictionary. Instead, there is an incorrect mapping for an empty string `''` to the value `1`. To fix this issue, I will update the `value_map` dictionary by replacing the incorrect mapping for `''` with the correct mapping for `'one'`.\n\nPrediction: If I replace the incorrect mapping `'' : 1` with `'one' : 1` in the `value_map` dictionary, the function will no longer raise a `KeyError` and will correctly sort the input string.\n\nExperiment: `REPLACE(11, \"'' : 1\", \"'one' : 1\") AND RUN`\nObservation: `expr '' : 1 not found in line 11`\nConclusion:The hypothesis is rejected due to experiment error. The attempt to replace the incorrect mapping `'' : 1` with `'one' : 1` in the `value_map` dictionary failed because the exact expression `'' : 1` was not found in line 11. This suggests that the syntax or representation of the dictionary in the code may differ slightly from what was assumed. I need to refine the experiment to ensure the correct replacement is made.\n\n---\n\n### ", "prompt_at_repair": "# Debugging Log\n\nAuthored by Linus Torvalds.\n\nI use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion.
