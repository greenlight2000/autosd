Prediction: If I use the debugger to inspect the value of `response.text` and the `BeautifulSoup` object after line 20, I will find that `response.text` contains valid HTML content, but the `BeautifulSoup` object is not being created correctly, leading to the function returning `None`.

Hypothesis: Given that the previous hypothesis was rejected and the variable `response` is not defined, the issue likely lies in the mocking of `requests.get` in the test case. Specifically, I think the `requests.get` mock is not properly configured to return a valid response object with the expected attributes (`status_code`, `content`, etc.), causing the function to fail before reaching the point where `BeautifulSoup` is instantiated.

Prediction: If I inspect the configuration of the `mock_get` object in the test case, I will find that it is not returning a valid response object with the expected attributes. This would cause the function to behave incorrectly, potentially raising an exception or returning `None`.

The observation shows that the `mock_get.return_value` is indeed a `MagicMock` object, and its `status_code` and `content` attributes are being mocked correctly. However, the issue lies in the fact that the `response.text` attribute is not being explicitly mocked. The `requests.get` mock is returning a `MagicMock` object, but the `text` attribute (which is derived from `content` and `encoding`) is not properly simulated. This causes the function to fail when it tries to access `response.text`, leading to the function returning `None`.

I use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion. This can be done by:

Hypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.

 - Example hypothesis 1: ""Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].""
 - Example hypothesis 2: ""The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].""
 - Example hypothesis 3: ""The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.""
 - Example hypothesis 4: ""The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].""

Prediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.

 - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.
 - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.

Experiment: A specific one-line script within `...` that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).

 - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`
 - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, ""c>b"", ""c>b && a <= d"") AND RUN`

Observation: The output of the script. Example: `False`

Conclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. 
 - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]
