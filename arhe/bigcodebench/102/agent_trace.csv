Hypothesis: Given that the previous hypothesis was rejected and `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif']` is an empty list after the assignment, the issue may be related to how `matplotlib` handles font settings. Specifically, I think the assignment `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = 'Arial'` is incorrect because `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif']` expects a list of font names, not a single string. As a result, the font setting is not being applied correctly.

Prediction: If I change the assignment `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = 'Arial'` to `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['Arial']` (a list containing the font name), the value of `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif']` will correctly include `'Arial'`.

This suggests that setting `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif']` alone does not change the global font family to use `'Arial'`.

Hypothesis: Given that the previous hypothesis was supported and the test still fails, the issue may be related to the global font family setting. Specifically, I think that setting `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif']` alone is insufficient to apply the desired font globally. Instead, the global font family must explicitly be set to `'sans-serif'` (or another appropriate family) in addition to specifying `'Arial'` as the preferred sans-serif font. This can be achieved by setting `plt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'sans-serif'` before or after setting `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif']`.

Prediction: If I add the line `plt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'sans-serif'` before or after the line `plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['Arial']`, the value of `plt.rcParams['font.family']` will correctly include `'sans-serif'`, and `'Arial'` will be recognized as the preferred sans-serif font.

The observation indicates that the experiment script could not be parsed correctly, likely due to a syntax issue or an incorrect format in the `INSERT` and `REPLACE` commands. Specifically, the error message suggests that the command requires three arguments, but the provided syntax does not meet this requirement.

To resolve this, I will refine the experiment by ensuring the correct syntax for the `INSERT` and `REPLACE` commands. The corrected experiment should explicitly specify the line number, the original code, and the replacement or insertion code.

**Hypothesis**: Given that the previous hypothesis was undecided due to an experiment error, the issue remains unresolved. Specifically, I think the failure occurs because the global font family is not explicitly set to `'sans-serif'`, and the test checks for `'Arial'` in `plt.rcParams['font.family']`.

**","### Attempt 9.

**Hypothesis**: Given that the previous hypothesis was rejected due to repeated syntax errors in the experiment script, the issue remains unresolved. Specifically, I think the failure occurs because the global font family is not explicitly set to 'sans-serif', and the test checks for 'Arial' in plt.rcParams['font.family']. To address this, I need to ensure both plt.rcParams['font.family'] is set to 'sans-serif' and plt",*** SyntaxError: invalid syntax,"The hypothesis is **rejected**. The observation indicates that the experiment script contains a syntax error, which prevents it from running correctly. Specifically, the `INSERT` and `REPLACE` commands are not valid Python syntax, and the experiment script must be refined to use proper debugging tools or manual code edits.

To resolve this, I will refine the experiment by directly editing the code manually to include the necessary changes. This will ensure that the syntax is correct and the experiment can be executed without errors.

I use the _scientific method_ to debug the problem below (as written by Zeller, 2009) by describing the hypothesis/prediction/experiment/observation/conclusion. This can be done by:

Hypothesis: An explanation for the buggy behavior behavior. Hypotheses are the key aspect of the approach, and should be detailed and written with care. Hypotheses should build upon all previous information; repeating previous hypotheses is thus strongly discouraged. Some examples are provided below.

 - Example hypothesis 1: ""Given that [information], the method is [overall erroneous behavior]. Specifically, I think it is because `c>b` on line 4321 of method `foo` is intended to [desired behavior], but is [erroneous behavior].""
 - Example hypothesis 2: ""The previous hypothesis was rejected. we now know `c>b` on line 4321 of the method `foo` is likely not the culprit. Looking elsewhere, perhaps `x.append(y)` on line 4323 of `foo` should do [desired behavior], but is doing [erroneous behavior].""
 - Example hypothesis 3: ""The previous hypothesis was supported. I think changing the code by changing `c>b` to `c>b && a <= d` may fix the code.""
 - Example hypothesis 4: ""The previous experiment ended in an error. We may need to try a different experiment. Perhaps the experiment can be refined by inspecting the value of [expression] at line [line].""

Prediction: A specific value or symptom that would be observed if the hypothesis is correct. Depending on the hypothesis, one may make the prediction that a test will pass. Make specific considerations for expressions within loops.

 - Example 1: If I use the debugger to print [expr], while given the input and its intended role indicates that its value should be [desired value], it will be [erroneous value]; that is, when I stop the debugger at line lineno, `[expr] == [actual_value]` will be true.
 - Example 2: If I change [expr] to [new_expr], the test will pass.

Experiment: A specific one-line script within `...` that would check whether the prediction made is true. Make sure the line points to an actual statement (not a bracket).

 - Example 1 (pdb script): `b debugging.py:lineno ;; c ;; p x != v`
 - Example 2 (edit script): `REPLACE(4321, ""c>b"", ""c>b && a <= d"") AND RUN`

Observation: The output of the script. Example: `False`

Conclusion: A judgement whether the hypothesis is true based on the observation. Also add <DEBUGGING DONE> when the hypothesis confirmed leads to a concrete program fix. 
 - Example: The hypothesis is (supported/rejected/undecided due to experiment error). [When a test passed, add <DEBUGGING DONE>.]
